            <h1>THE BIG THREE</h1>
            <p>
                <span>The Big Three was a term used to describe the three most popular running series during their golden age in Jump - One Piece, Naruto and Bleach.</span> All three series got their common title due to their worldwide popularity and length. With that they were always featured in front of the shared Shonen Jump covers with bigger images for their main characters Luffy, Naruto and Ichigo, than the rest of the current lineup of series.

<span>The three series received long running anime series, Naruto is 720 episodes long, Bleach is 366 episodes long and One Piece has 929 episodes as of June 2020 and with One Piece and Naruto sequel Boruto still airing.</span> Those statistics do not include the spin-offs, sequels and movies, so the full numbers for entire franchises are higher. All three are shounen (action) series about adventure and drama with a lot of subplots and one main, core plot. They have a lot of fight scenes and strong protagonists who are a little foolish and dumb.

        <h1>NEW GEN TOP 4</h1>
        <p>
            While quite different at a glance, <span> Jujutsu Kaisen has managed to fill the void left by Bleach after the anime was cancelled and the manga finished in a way no other has been able to do. </span> Featuring its own character with a reddish hair that has a monster living inside of him and fights demonic creatures with supernatural powers, it's easy to see the similarities between the two shows. That being said, it's how Jujutsu Kaisen has managed to distance itself from its predecessor that makes it so worth the watch.
            Probably the most obvious to any viewer, <span>My Hero Academia acts as the perfect successor to Naruto.</span> For many fans of Naruto, it was hard not to notice the similarities between the show almost immediately. They both feature a young boy with lackluster abilities with a potential for greatness if given the proper the training and support. They also both introduce a rival characters that motivate the protagonist to get stronger as well as a strong and likable supporting casts. They both even have evil organizations that are led by a timeless old foe.
            This one is arguably a bit of a stretch, <span> but in many ways Demon Slayer has become something of a successor to One Piece. While in the last two examples the new shows shared many commonalities with their predecessors, in this situation it's more about the role that they each have played.</span> They both take an established story premise and manage to breathe enough new life into it that they are able to stand apart from the rest of the competition. Which is probably why they are each some of the most successful manga to be published in the last few years.
